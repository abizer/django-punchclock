# django-punchclock

A simple employee punchclock / timekeeping app for Django. Written for my own use (liberally borrowing from online resources) but sufficiently simple that someone could probably adapt it for their own use pretty easily, if not use it out of the box. There are no requirements, and users are created manually in the Django admin.
